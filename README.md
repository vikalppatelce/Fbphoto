Fbphoto - Graph Api
=======

Used Graph Api for global purpose not using android-facebook-sdk method much to resolve the portability.

Fetching Photos From Facebook via Graph Api.

Setting Limit to 30 initially and extending as GridView Scrolled down to the last photo i.e 30th one.

Still AysncTask is clashing down as stating Error : AysncTask already runnning error; which need to be resolved asap.
